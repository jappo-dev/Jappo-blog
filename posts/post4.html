            <h3> Finishing my Thesis in the meantime</h1></h1>
            <p>
              It's been a while! The last couple of weeks have been crazy busy. Besides working a lot on finishing my thesis I also had to work parttime (which meant over 20 hours for the last couple of weeks) and of course I wanted to get at least some time into web development. Although the latter did not really work out the way I wanted to. So here I am telling you that the 100 day coding challenge is probably going to be moved to next year. It just makes a lot more sense to me and in the meantime I will definitely keep progressing but not with this specific timeframe on my shoulders.
            </p>
            <h4>Keep having fun</h4>
            <p>
              Something personal, maybe even something you might be familiar with... Enjoying life. The last few weeks I have come te realized that not often enough we take a step back and enjoy the things that happen to and around us. A cozy family evening, a game night with some friends or an old school college party. Being a student does bring a lot of pressure and responsibilities with it but it also comes with a lot of fun to make it potentially the greatest time of your life. So my advice to each and every one of you, take some time to enjoy it! both the big and the little moments.
            </p>
            <h4>100 day coding challenges</h4>
            <p>
              As I mentioned before, the challenge will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. With my current schedule there is no way I would still be a normal functioning human being if I tried to stick to this challenge. And that is okay, point of the challenge is toe familiarize myself with a topic that I do not understand well enough. My journey has only just started and the road ahead is looking both challenging but also glorious. I am gonna take the time I need to get everything sorted and than go for it will all the willpower that lives inside of me. I can not wait for the year 2022 to come, it is going to be a great year!
