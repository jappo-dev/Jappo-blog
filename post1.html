            <h3> About me</h1></h1>
            <p>
              Hi there! Thanks for reading my first blogpost.
              My Name is Jasper Pastoor, I am a 25 year old student from the Netherlands and currently working on finishing my master thesis for my Business Administrion study.
              In the meantime I love working on web development, it's something that I have been interested in for a long time but only since the pandemic started have I made the conscious effort and dedication to start learning it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A little but more about who I am:
              I love sports, programming and of course having the occasional drink.
              I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands but have since them moved to the big city and I couldn't be happier about that.
              Life is moving much faster here but that's what makes it much more interesting, for me at least.
            </p>
            <h4>My goals</h4>
            <p>
              Web development has been a hobby but so far I haven't really thought about what I want to accomplish with it.
              One of the dreams I have had since I was a little kid was to start my own company.
              Perhaps web development is the right space for that... only time will tell.
              For now I have been following the web development bootcamp on Udemy (great website for checking out a lot of useful courses), been connecting with the techside of Twitter (bunch of great guys and gals on there) and I have been asking friends and family for their view on web development and if they needed help with some of their projects.
              And finally, I started this Blog. I created the webspace for it and will be updating it as regularly as possible.
            </p>
            <h4>100 day coding challenges</h4>
            <p>
              So one of the main challenges involving coding and web development these days is the so-called 100 days coding challenge. Most of you might be familiar with this and I would love to give it a shot as long as it does not interfere with my study duties.
